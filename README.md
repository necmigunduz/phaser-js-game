> Capstone project in the Microverse JavaScript Curriculum

Implementation of a Space Shooter Game built with the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) framework

## About The Project

The main goal of this project is to build a platform game. Phaser and Javascript are the main technologies used to develop this project.

Live version of the project: [Live version](https://shooting-necmi.herokuapp.com/)

Project Link: [Javascript-Capstone](https://github.com/necmigunduz/phaser-js-game)

## The game

This is a never-ending game. User faces different alien ships at random times. User uses laser (Space) to shoot and explode enemy ships. Every different enemy ship shot adds a differnet point to the user's score. When the user's ship is shot by an enemy laser, or an enemy ship touches the user's ship, the game ends. The user can restart the game. Also, users' high scores are stored in an API, and users can display the highest ten scores in the scoreboard scene.

### Game design

The game uses one laser sprite, one user ship, four enemy ships, and two backgrounds. Two backgrounds are displayed on each other to create a more interesting background and higher contrast. The user ship is black and white to have a high contrast with the background. The enemy ships have fantastic desings, and they are relatively more colored to create a confusion with the dark background with low contrast. There is a background music, and an explosion sound in the game.
